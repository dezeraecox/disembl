## disembl
fork of [DisEMBL v1.4](http://dis.embl.de/)

This fork of DisEMBL is an almost-complete rewrite of the Python code. The regions
identified as disordered do not change.

[TISEAN](www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/) Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter is replaced by 
Scipy's since it ends up being faster (no stdin/stdout necessary).

The original calculation will be available via '--old' but will be removed in
further versions.
