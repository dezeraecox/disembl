This fork of [DisEMBL v1.4](http://dis.embl.de/) represents a significant
rewriting of the code without changing the scores/regions identified as
disordered.

Much of the Python code is revised.
[TISEAN](www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/)'s Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter is replaced
by [Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html)'s
since it ends up being faster (no stdin/stdout necessary). C code is wrapped
directly instead of through stdin/out and subprocess. These changes result in
significant speed increase and will future simplify maintenance.
